## ToDo list âœ…

[ ] Open your terminal (terminal, Git Bash) and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project using the `cd` command. Create a new directory named `band-website` for your project, `cd` into it, and open Visual Studio Code by running (one at a time):
```
mkdir band-website
cd band-website
code .
```

[ ] Create a new HTML file named `index.html` and add the basic HTML structure:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>The Rockstars</title>
</head>
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to The Devs' Official Website</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <!-- Band logo will go here -->
        <!-- Concert pictures will go here -->
        <!-- Music video will go here -->
    </main>

</body>
</html>
```

[ ] Use the `<img>` tag to add the logo (located in `./assets/images`) to the webpage:
```
<header>
    <h1>Welcome to The Devs' Official Website</h1>
    <img src="./assets/images/band.jpg" alt="The Devs Band" width="200">
</header>
```

[ ]  Use the `<img>` tag to add concert images (located in `./assets/images`) to the webpage:
```
<main>
    <h2>Our Latest Concert</h2>
    <img src="./assets/images/concert1.jpg" alt="The Devs performing live" width="200">
    <img src="./assets/images/concert2.jpg" alt="Audience enjoying the concert" width="200">
</main>
```

[ ] Use the `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` tags to add a caption to one of the concert pictures:
```
<main>
    <h2>Our Latest Concert</h2>
    <figure>
        <img src="./assets/images/concert1.jpg" alt="The Devs performing live" width="200">
        <figcaption>The Devs rocking the stage!</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <img src="./assets/images/concert2.jpg" alt="Audience enjoying the concert" width="200">
</main>
```

[ ] Use the `<video>` tag to embed the band's latest music video under the images. Ensure the video has controls:
```
<h2>Watch Our Latest Music Video</h2>
<video src="./assets/videos/music-video.mp4" controls muted style="max-width: 100%;">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
